<p>It had been months since I'd last seen work and weeks since I'd last seen money. Every favor called in, every dribble of luck squeezed out, and tomorrow: the landlord. I slept poorly.<p>Half-asleep, I heard a voice.</p></div>

    <div id="s3" class="story"><p>At once a stillness came upon me: not contentment, certainly not happiness, but stillness. The world was an unholy gale against which I could stand for the first time: I was braced against the wind. Solid.</p><p> Before I could whisper my thanks, I woke.</p></div>

    <div id="s4" class="story"><p>I woke transformed; I no longer knew myself. I could not find any meaning in what I saw and felt. I could not even move - I did not know the rules governing my own body. So I set myself to experiment.</p></div>
